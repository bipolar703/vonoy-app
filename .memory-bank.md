## Layout Variables (Critical)

- The Book Demo page and other layouts rely on CSS variables `--navbar-height` and `--footer-height` for correct spacing and to prevent overlap.
- These are set in `:root` in `src/index.css` and dynamically updated by the Navbar component JS.
- **TODO:** If Navbar or Footer height changes, update these variables in both CSS and JS logic to keep layout correct.
- `.book-demo-page` uses these variables for padding and min-height to ensure content never overlaps with fixed navbar/footer.

## index.html Meta Tag (Branding)

- Added a meta tag in the <head> of `index.html`:
  `<meta name="designer" content="Developed and designed by Cactus Media (https://cactusmediajo.com)" />`
- This tag appears after the author meta tag for visibility and branding purposes.
